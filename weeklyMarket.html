      They are held once a week on a specific day with temporary shops, and
      sometimes have a name associated to the day they open and they close by
      evening.Have a slow maintenance cost as like the other markets they don't
      have to pay workers or pay rent fro anything thus they have bargains and
      cheap Products.They have unbranded and home made Products.All type of
      goods and other things can be found here like: groceries, cloth, items,
      utensils and etc.In the market many traders might sell the same good thus
      there is a competition between the traders.
